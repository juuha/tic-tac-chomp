# tic-tac-chomp

## A Discord bot for a more complex tic-tac-toe game using the new Discord buttons

The game consists of a 3x3 board with 3 sizes of pieces. Similarly to regular tic-tac-toe 3 in a row wins. The difference is that larger pieces can eat smaller pieces, which then replaces that piece with the larger piece. Pieces can also be moved to a different tile, however smaller pieces that were eaten will escape from a moving piece's mouth and reappear on the original tile. Therefore the player must remember which tiles have which pieces, when they can only see the largest piece on each tile.
